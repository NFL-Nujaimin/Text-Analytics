Mr Dakgalbi @ IOI City Mall,Mooi Me,1,"1). For those who have not tasted the original chuncheon Dakgalbi, it is a can do. For the gochujang sauce and that's about it.
However,  be aware in this place:
2).  it is served and cooked the lazy "" rojak "" way - imagine the rice cake, ramen AND fried rice all cooked together same time ! Not the quality korean way !
3). Cooked in front of you by bangladesh server in grubby T Shirt, no head cover. No sight of a korean nor a trained cook.
4). Zero Service and  courtesy. No Annyeonghaseyo ! No korean atmosphere ! Not even open the door for wheelchair bound. Not even thank you !
5). Despite closed Aircond, still some flys
Thus out of max scale of 5,
Authenticity is 2.5, Cooking style is 1, Service is 1. Only for the younger ones trying their first taste of korean food.",1 tasted original chuncheon dakgalbi gochujang sauce however aware place 2 served cooked lazy rojak way imagine rice cake ramen fried rice cooked together time quality korean way 3 cooked front bangladesh server grubby shirt head cover sight korean trained cook 4 zero service courtesy annyeonghaseyo korean atmosphere even open door wheelchair bound even thank 5 despite closed aircond still fly thus max scale 5 authenticity cooking style 1 service younger one trying first taste korean food,positive,positive,negative

Ombak Kitchen @ IOI City Mall,danie salleh,2,"Hii! This is my honest review and experience. Its a long one but its the full dive of my experience here

IFTAR DAHLIA

Tbh I was expecting more. The place is packed. You try to maximize profit at the cost of customers comfort. You add so many tables to earn more customer yet you cant entertain your customer. On your advertisement the seafood on ice counter is on the outside. So i expect queuing would be a comfort. But you had to change cuz you want to add more seat outside. Then we queue in between tables inside the small place. Whats worst is that its slow. The bowl and plate ok the counter has finished yet no one bother to refill the plates.

And the audacity of one of your employee to ask me in a rude manners while i was waiting for them to refill the plate ‚ÄúTunggu apa lagi?‚Äù Bro i was waiting for the plate that you didnt refill. Even the counter is empty since no one refill the food.

It might sound as if I am mad about it and am not satisfied. But imagine being in my place, for me to be the person on the front of the line waiting for some plates, after you refill the plates i ask you guys to refill the food since the refill container is just on the side. But your employee said they will call someone else to refill. And i had to stand there ‚Äúmenahan maki‚Äù from people at back who doesnt know the situation of there is no food on the counter and is quite mas that they are waiting for so long.

- The seafood on ice
Mussel and scallops is good but the oyster. It does have some bad aftertaste. It doesn‚Äôt feel fresh.

- Seafood Combo
When i arrived they‚Äôve cooked siap siap and placed on the table inside a plastic. Its cold. If it were still hot it might have tasted better. And bro, how you cook the crab? How come tak masak. The crab pincer is raw man. The best part and you made it raw. My day in your restaurant is already bad and you manage to made it worst. Other than that the food taste is ok. So so. Would be better if its hot. I understand its iftar and you need to entertain and serve the food to the whole crowd. But there are better ways to keep the food warm.

- Atmosphere
Its nice. Eating by the pool. But if its windy and its blowing at you you‚Äôll feel some drizzle from the fountain. Good view. Theres a hanging fan outside so it doesnt get hot.

Service
Cold. No smile. One rude guy but let‚Äôs keep it a secret. Like i said didnt refill the food and the plate bla bla bla. And also i asked for the crab cracker tool so i could feast on my long awaited crab pincer but i had to wait for 15-20 minutes. Didnt get the tool. Well after a while they came and cracked the crab for us. But for us to wait that long its better if they just give us the tool and let us just do it ourselves. We are mad enough with the things we have been through and you made us wait even more, its just adding more fuel to the flame. You could have provided one for each table. Also we are not offered plastic glove to use. But they have like tons of box of plastic glove on their receiving counter.",hii honest review experience long one full dive experience iftar dahlia tbh expecting place packed try maximize profit cost customer comfort add many table earn customer yet cant entertain customer advertisement seafood ice counter outside expect queuing would comfort change cuz want add seat outside queue table inside small place whats worst slow bowl plate ok counter finished yet one bother refill plate audacity one employee ask rude manner waiting refill plate tunggu apa lagi bro waiting plate didnt refill even counter empty since one refill food might sound mad satisfied imagine place person front line waiting plate refill plate ask guy refill food since refill container side employee said call someone else refill stand menahan maki people back doesnt know situation food counter quite ma waiting long seafood ice mussel scallop good oyster bad aftertaste feel fresh seafood combo arrived cooked siap siap placed table inside plastic cold still hot might tasted better bro cook crab come tak masak crab pincer raw man best part made raw day restaurant already bad manage made worst food taste would better hot understand iftar need entertain serve food whole crowd better way keep food warm atmosphere nice eating pool windy blowing feel drizzle fountain good view there hanging fan outside doesnt get hot service cold smile one rude guy let keep secret like said didnt refill food plate bla bla bla also asked crab cracker tool could feast long awaited crab pincer wait minute didnt get tool well came cracked crab u u wait long better give u tool let u mad enough thing made u wait even adding fuel flame could provided one table also offered plastic glove use like ton box plastic glove receiving counter,positive,positive,negative

Ambience wise, very clean, spacious, nice decor, macam 'sea' concept. Service is also very good. They even gave us testers to see which one we like. Decided to order Singapore chilli & cajun crab.

Singapore one is quite sweet, sour with a mild spicy taste, paired well with their seafood, but the ketam cajun wow, literally foodgasm. Buttery, spicy, full of flavour. Semua fresh here. Hence the steep price point. But I think it's worth it. You get what you paid for.

Snack wise, would recommend sweet potato fries and golden bread. You can cicah with the ketam sauce, very nice.

Ombak Kitchen @ IOI City Mall,bobby bob,1,"have you ever seen a beautiful lady with long luscious hair from behind, but when they turn around it's a guy? that is how eating here felt. the advertising and online menu made the food look amazing, but the actual food served was appalling at best. the ""XL crab"" was terribly small and overcooked, and the other seafood in the combo tasted cheap and unsatisfactory.

the worst part about the experience was actually not the food, as terrible as it was. when i attempted to get the attention of the waitress, she noticed us calling for her, but continued using her phone as if we were waving to her saying hello. after multiple attempts, she finally relented to receiving our feedback, and promptly called the manager.

the manager was extremely polite, and spoke calmly and confidently, and told us that he would give us a new crab to replace the poorly cooked one. we waited for awhile, before realising that said crab was not going to arrive. we decided to pay and did receive a 10% discount, but it felt like a discount from the terrible ""service charge"" rather than from the horrendous food. this honestly made sense, since the service at this outlet did not justify the 10% service charge.

if you ever decide that you are masochistic enough to enjoy torturous food and contemptuous stares from service staff, do give this place a try.",ever seen beautiful lady long luscious hair behind turn around guy eating felt advertising online menu made food look amazing actual food served appalling best xl crab terribly small overcooked seafood combo tasted cheap unsatisfactory worst part experience actually food terrible attempted get attention waitress noticed u calling continued using phone waving saying hello multiple attempt finally relented receiving feedback promptly called manager manager extremely polite spoke calmly confidently told u would give u new crab replace poorly cooked one waited awhile realising said crab going arrive decided pay receive 10 discount felt like discount terrible service charge rather horrendous food honestly made sense since service outlet justify 10 service charge ever decide masochistic enough enjoy torturous food contemptuous stare service staff give place try,negative,negative,negative

Ombak Kitchen @ IOI City Mall,Farah Suhaime,1,"WORST EXPERIENCE!

My recent visit to Ombak Kitchen IOI City Mall was a complete disaster, marred by appalling service and dismal food quality.

The service was shockingly neglectful, with waiters nowhere to be found and existing staff disturbingly indifferent to customer needs but laughing out loud seems even more important than keeping a peaceful environment for customers to eat. Our dishes were carelessly placed on the table's edge, and the overall lack of professionalism was inexcusable given the restaurant's purported upscale status.

As for the food, the baby octopus garlic butter I ordered was a tasteless, overcooked disappointment, bearing no resemblance to its promised flavors. It's evident that the kitchen staff lacks basic culinary competence. Even worse it feels like i am chewing on rubber. The garlic butter sauce doesn't even taste like garlic butter more like eating sweet and sour baby octopus.

Definitely would not be coming here again next time.",worst experience recent visit ombak kitchen ioi city mall complete disaster marred appalling service dismal food quality service shockingly neglectful waiter nowhere found existing staff disturbingly indifferent customer need laughing loud seems even important keeping peaceful environment customer eat dish carelessly placed table edge overall lack professionalism inexcusable given restaurant purported upscale status food baby octopus garlic butter ordered tasteless overcooked disappointment bearing resemblance promised flavor evident kitchen staff lack basic culinary competence even worse feel like chewing rubber garlic butter sauce even taste like garlic butter like eating sweet sour baby octopus definitely would coming next time,negative,negative,negative

Cons
1) Seating
I was seated outside infront of the fountain. The view was nice and my kid enjoyed it while eating. Just there was no babychair and you gotta pay attention to your kids.
The inside seating was cramp, the mini buffet is inside. I would not recommend eating inside

2) The Mini Buffet- Seafood On Ice
One word ""Frozen"". The oyster and mussels tasted very bland and the oyster was not freshly shucked. You're falsely advertising ""fresh oysters""

3) Shell-Out
Underwhelming shell out. Potato was hard, just one sausage. Too much cajun sauce, and frozen sotong??? really Ombak Kitchen

Pros
1) Mini Buffet
The buffet beside the seafood on ice was good, the dessert, drinks and spaghetti were good

The waitress (the malay girl with long red hair) was also rude and tarik muka when we asked to change our seat area. The indoor seating was very noisy and loud. Not sure if it‚Äôs club or restaurant but totally not recommended with old people to seat inside. Also, do you know what‚Äôs the most unhygienic thing in the restaurant? Some people think it may be toilet but no, you are wrong! The most unhygienic thing is THE MENU! Because everyone will touch the menu and I dont think you santize your menu, right? And these menu were placed on top of our white paper , the same place our food would be placed to it. Totally unhygienic. You should spread out the paper after we ordered, not before we came in.

Ombak Kitchen @ IOI City Mall,Adam Imanullah,1,"We came at about 7.45pm, before the place got packed. The waitress tried to tell us the place was fully reserved, but most of the seats were not displayed as so. We ordered The Royal Platter, 2 sides and 3 drinks. Waitress took our order confidently without writing it down, gotta say, I was pretty impressed. About 30 mins in our drinks and sides came, no issue. 8.40pm, the restaurant was already packed, and the main dish came, except it wasn't what we ordered. It was order for the group behind us. We overheard the waitress telling another waitress to ""angkat bawak belakang, tambah sauce je"" which roughly translates to, ""bring it to back and just add sauce"", by 9pm we started seeing tables thst came after us receiving their order. So we decided to leave because we knew our order got pushed to the bottom of the list, and we would have to wait for another hour. I explained what I could to the manager, and he tried to say that the Platter was on the house ü§£ When it didn't even arrive. All of this could've been avoided if the waitress had WRITTEN DOWN HER ORDER.

1/5 rating.

Nando's @ IOI City Mall,L W Kot,1,"We chose to dine here seeing that there's not much people whereas every place else were packed. Ordered and chose pay at counter. There were 3 staffs at the counter area, i stood there and signalled to pay (politely, with a smile i guarantee you). Among the 3 there's a plus size middle age lady who glanced at me while she moves away from the counter, i can almost hear the words 'great another d*mn customer' coming from her face. Ouch. Ok no worries, maybe she's not qualified to handle the delicate buttons on the counter machine. There's 2 more staffs left there. One of them is an Indian lady that looked like the manager there. I signalled to pay again, but they were so immersed in their conversation like they were planning their wedding or something and didn't noticed me. I signalled to pay again, and she gave me the hand ü§ö! Holy cow i wanted to get into that conversation too because it seemed like a topic concerning the whole humanity there.

Anyways eventually i paid. No choice because if we change venue my spouse might land a hand ü§ö on my soft face due to hunger and i don't want to risk that.

As we were eating, i observed that there's another customer coming to counter. This time there's no one there, only the Indian manager lady writing things at the table near the counter. The customer is like John Travolta in Pulp Fiction looking for Mia as there's no one there to entertain him. And i can see the Indian manager lady trying real hard to not notice the customer. After a while there's finally a staff coming to the counter and handled the customer's payment. To my surprise, it was the plus size middle age lady staff from just now! Oh, i thought you can't handle the counter, turns out you can! Why did you looked at me just now like i am here to bring you the news of your unpaid taxes?

Anyway. This might as well be our last time coming to Nandos no matter what branch. As i heard it from others (hearsay, i know) that their services elsewhere is similarly subpar. Times are tough, money is not easily earned. If that's the attitude you show me when i want to hand you my hard earned money, it's better if i hand them over to sincerely hardworking food handlers elsewhere. Food and atmosphere were just okay. Maybe biased due to the bitter look i received just now that made its way to my taste buds and soft heart.Might need to hug mama soon to get over this terrible tragedy.

- Rude & lazy staffs (especially the servers & waiters)
- Slow serving time
- Cherry picking customers
- Inefficient managers
- Mediocre feel of exclusivity

Totally DO NOT recommend coming here especially during peak hours. I regretted coming here to treat my family for a nice dinner. What we got is totally disgusting behaviours of the waiters. Their waiters (*especially the younger males) have the audacity to treat customers like vermins.

We tried calling them to ask for the menus, but they ignored us. When one of the waiter came at the table with the menu he throwed it on the table & just walk away. We are dumbfounded by his behaviour. We couldn't ask to get our glasses refill without feeling so bad by the rude stares of the staffs & them passing by ignoring our requests.

We felt much worse when they treated a rich & good looking customers like VVIP  (pulling their chairs for them & waited for orders) compared to other customers. We saw the ill treatments of other customers in front of our eyes. They argued with each other on who to serve us (the poor looking normal customers).

If you value your time & want have a good time DO NOT COME.

The black shirt server also seem to be lack of knowledge of what the restaurant offers.

KyoChon 1991 @ IOI City Mall,Ryne,1,"I didn't know that you need to order spicy flavor to make your chicken feel hot. Feel like it's been there for an hour before they even serve it. Like their tag line. ""Chicken like you never had before""

But in fairness I ordered a different set of chicken.....again. Thank goodness, it was hot this time. Maybe, I just didnt get lucky on the first time. But alas! That's the only thing that is hot. I ordered 5 different things to try in there but no luck. Been to other branch and it is not like this branch. Kudos to you! Your on the top list of worst Kyochon I experienced. Keep it up!

I didnt bother to ask them to replace the 1st order since i dont want to bother them so much since they look like they are sooo busy that day and I want to help them in my own way.

Soup was room temperature, not cold not hot. Just plain dull soup. What a soup!!! You know what happen when I got my HOT tea?! Yeeeesssss.... room temperature as well. Nice. But I asked them to replace it.

Mobile signal is not good on their shop so I connected on their free wifi. Thanks for the connection and that helps me get entertained while waiting for my food that takes time to be serve (28min) for only the 1st order and guess the rest. I understand this is not a fast food. So make sure you have at least time when you eat here. It's like 1 hr waiting for your food and 10 min you eat.

They do have 10% service charge but you need to go to the counter to order by your own. Not sure if its a trend or something or they just don't have enough people working that day.

Looks like no ones doing a quality check on the food in the kitchen. Even the person who serves the food on the floor didn't even bother to check the orders before serving. So much for your service charge, fast food do it better in my experience. But maybe it's just not my lucky day or I'm picky. Charge to experience perhaps.

Then I checked my receipt and noticed that 1 order was not served, so I ask them, and they gave it. Since I am already done eating before it arrive and I just take away the food. Saying sorry is a good courtesy but let me a say it for you. Sorry, if I ask you to get my food and ask to have it tapau after you serve.... super... late....

The person in charge in the counter is good. Precise and he even repeated my order which some resto didn't even do anymore. At least they are good at something. Taking away our money. Joke. They are quick on cleaning the table after a customer left. He even smiled when he saw me leaving. I smiled back, too. So that's a plus. He should get promoted! Har har har....

Then I realized. Maybe...  That's why you need to pay as soon as you order in the counter even before you sit in your chair (feels like a fast food? Right?) so that you can not complain much since you already paid for it or something. Maybe they had an experience that a customer didn't pay after they have a very good HOT NEW COOKED chicken. Now that's like a conspiracy theory. Go there and experience it yourself. Good luck!

Encounter bad smelling chicken during mco. Since it is a delivery in service and difficulty of going out during mco, we just tossed away some of the bad smelled chicken and never made a complaint.

Went for a dine in recently, ordered a few menu, complained about a drumstick which smells bad.
The manager came and tell us to wait for about 12mins so they could replace with 1 pcs of another drumstick.
But she insisted that she has inspected the chicken and THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CHICKEN (according To her) but since a complaint has been made, they want tp replace the chicken.

We agreed, we continue eating.

Yet, we found another piece of bad smell chicken. I call the waiter to confirm the smell coming from the chicken, and the waiter said, yes, there is a smell coming from the chicken. I even checked with my colleague on the table to confirm about the smell.

I call the manager again, and let her sniff on the chicken. But again, she said, NOTHING IS WRONG WITH THE CHICKEN.omg .  (So i guess no matter how i tried, she is still going to deny) and the manager said, ‚Äúif the food is not good, but we finished the dish‚Äù

What is wrong on finishing up our other dish as only part of the chicken is rotten???

Eventho she said the chicken is all good (after inspecting and sniffing the chicken) She insisted of giving us 15percent discount on total bill plus rm10 voucher.

I have a half chicken take out after, and later to find out 3 out of the half chicken has a rotten smell too. So disappointed.

When I asked the waiter to change it to what was originally ordered, he said that they were out of stock (but wasn't really because it came) so he changed it to something else.

I'd strongly recommend the service staff to be trained that:

1) if a waiter changes the order of a customer, they must be informed

2) the order that the waiter takes should be written in all cases to avoid misunderstandings

3) the order should be repeated until the waiter gets the order correct (re-repeat until necessary)

1. Long queue time outside. While waiting for my turn, i can see a lot of empty tables inside the premise. These tables were clean. But don't know why the staffs didn't call customers to enter. Maybe these tables only for decoration?? Some parents who waited with me already had their kids making noises due to long waiting time.

2. Limited menu, i can say 70% of the menu were sold out. Based on the reviews, this is unresolved issue since past few months. You should have taken some actions but obviously you did not.

3. Extremely slow service. Once i got in, immediately made my order via the website. And only got my food after more than half an hour.

4. Food were not hotly served. Be it chicken or fries. The taste? Nothing special. I can't taste the freshness. I thought you cook upon receiving the order that was why you took a long time. But what with this?

5. Unfriendly staff especially the cashier. Didn't say 'Thank you' after we paid. I thought that is just a common sense as a cashier to say 'Thank You' to their customers. And another thing is she did not smile at all. Muka ketat sungguh!

So overall, I can say that you don't have a proper system. From queuing outside, available menus, food waiting, and the staff behaviour.. all out!!

First of all, the staff mistake our food and serve it to next table. This is something every1 can tolerate. Then the staff take the food from their table and place on our table. This trigger my anger as I don't understand whether is the staff understand the manner of food was served and the customer already took a piece of it, pls don't take that plate and move to other ppl eventhou claiming the food wrongly served!!! Come on, even the hawker stalls also know this manner.
Secondly, not to mention about COVID things, the next table those not started to eat anything yet already open their mask busy chit chat in front of our food which going to serve to us later!! After learning that they are about to serve us that saliva splitting food, we raise the issue regarding this, the staff reply us ""dia-orang cuma ambil satu ketul saje.... kalau nak remake kena tunggu 30min"" with a impatient tune with us which add on more fire to my anger. But still we tolerate and we strongly mention okay we wait for another 30mins.
Thirdly, a guy waiter come over just about 3 mins instead of 30mins to serve us and claim that this is correct one from the kitchen and this is not that saliva splitting one as he said ""sudah tukar"" Now how I know whether this not the saliva splitting food since the staff bring that saliva food to kitchen and the new one came out from the kitchen also. Aduh~~~u should let the saliva-splitting one served at original customer while I wait for the next one out freshly from the kitchen.
Fourthly, we were fed up, and we accept whatever it is. But before we eat, we count the pieces of chicken shoud be 20 instead of 19!!!!!! What the hellllll mannnn~~~~!!!! U ada tukar ke tak niiii!!!
To recap, Kyochon breach it's own principles which is serve fast food already. Idk whether is prioritise over which customers and serve to us to ASAP.

KyoChon 1991 @ IOI City Mall,iedayah ieda,1,"Today (30/3/2021) I went to the kyocho 1991 ioi city mall outlet until about 2 pm. Waiting in line for me is no problem. But from the beginning we were not told how to order (this is the first time to eat walk-in, only ever bought online) but there was a paper on the table telling us to scan so we scanned it, then asked for a password to order. Satisfied, we looked for the password and couldn't find it when we called the staff, no one was there, when we looked at the staff, they just shouted the password from behind (very rude) when we said we didn't hear it, they showed us at the counter waiting for the number. We who came for the first time didn't know that there was no password to order.
Ok, I'm patient and continue to enter the password and order. Then wait 30 minutes for food. Only water and chicken.
We ordered kimchi rice, we had already eaten half of the chicken and the rice did not arrive.

Ask at the counter, the rude female staff does not serve, then stares at the order tab and gives an unapologetic and rude answer saying that the kimchi rice is slow and has to wait. I asked how long it took, even now I've been waiting for more than 30 minutes for the chicken to finish, he rudely said just wait.

And I started to get a little angry, I said that my chicken is finished and I don't want the kimchi rice.

We waited another 10 minutes and the rice still didn't arrive, we stopped eating the chicken to eat with the rice still didn't arrive. Another 10 minutes we continued to eat all the chicken and still not enough rice.

When we finished washing our hands, we wanted to pay for the rice until we waited almost an hour for the kimchi rice.

At the payment counter we said the rice was canceled and he seemed angry when we said the kimchi rice was slow. Hello, it's an hour late, you know, it's okay to wait, but no staff came to apologize and tell me that the kimchi rice will be late.
Don't think that all customers know that it will take an hour for the rice to cook!

And even more heartbreaking, there was no thank you or even an apology from the staff.

P/s: when I got to the staff there was water spilled near the child of the person in front of my table. Once again I did not hear an apology from the staff.

Please send staff for customer service
I used to review food and always here and there. This is my longest review I have ever done.
Even though sometimes there is slow food service, at least saying sorry will make us customers calm down again or thank you.

If there is a negative review, I will give a negative one.

This is the first and last time I will go to kyochon1991..
Although the food is good, the customer experience is very bad! The worst!

That's it, thank you (you can teach the staff the words thank you and sorry after this)",today went kyocho 1991 ioi city mall outlet 2 pm waiting line problem beginning told order first time eat ever bought online paper table telling u scan scanned asked password order satisfied looked password could find called staff one looked staff shouted password behind rude said hear showed u counter waiting number came first time know password order ok patient continue enter password order wait 30 minute food water chicken ordered kimchi rice already eaten half chicken rice arrive ask counter rude female staff serve stare order tab give unapologetic rude answer saying kimchi rice slow wait asked long took even waiting 30 minute chicken finish rudely said wait started get little angry said chicken finished want kimchi rice waited another 10 minute rice still arrive stopped eating chicken eat rice still arrive another 10 minute continued eat chicken still enough rice finished washing hand wanted pay rice waited almost hour kimchi rice payment counter said rice canceled seemed angry said kimchi rice slow hello hour late know okay wait staff came apologize tell kimchi rice late think customer know take hour rice cook even heartbreaking thank even apology staff got staff water spilled near child person front table hear apology staff please send staff customer service used review food always longest review ever done even though sometimes slow food service least saying sorry make u customer calm thank negative review give negative one first last time go kyochon1991 although food good customer experience bad worst thank teach staff word thank sorry,negative,negative,negative
