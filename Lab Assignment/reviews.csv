The green colour of this jersey is eye-catching and stands out in a crowd. It adds a vibrant touch to my sportswear collection.The quality of this jersey is outstanding. The fabric feels premium, and it is well-crafted with attention to detail.The fit of the jersey is perfect for me. It is neither too loose nor too tight, providing a comfortable and unrestricted range of motion.

HANDYMAN,Great colour great fit.,"
I did get an XXL first because the first one I got but a different colour and without the stripes was too big, so I returned and got an XL and it fits perfectly. I love the colour of this one and the price is great.
